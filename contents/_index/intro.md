## Welcome to my catalogue of presentations

This site holds the presentations that I have given at various conferences and will be updated accordingly. I am currently uploading slides so it will be a short while before it is complete.

### About my slides

The slides are created and presented using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). They were originally written using a variety of tools including Pin, LibreOffice Impress and Microsoft Powerpoint.

I have placed all the assets for the presentations in [GitHub](https://github.com/awafaa/presentations), comprising of the images used as well as the index.html for the presentations.
